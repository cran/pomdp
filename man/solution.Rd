\title{
Extract the Solution of a POMDP
}
\description{
The function extracts the solution of a POMDP as an object of class POMDP_solution which is a list containing, e.g., the policy graph (pg) and the hyper-plane coefficients (alpha).

object of class POMDP returned by \code{\link{solve_POMDP}}.
}
}

\value{
returns an object is of class POMDP_solution, i.e., a list of all solution elements.
